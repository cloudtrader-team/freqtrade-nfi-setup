## Important Thing to notice
### 1) Do not use this strategy on live. It is still undergoing dry-run. 
Using it live at your own risk.
### 2) Limit order buy (if high latency) / Market order buy (if low latency) 
Or get rekt by slippage.
### 3) If you want to use it on other exchanges (not kucoin), 
You may need to re-hyperopt, the strategy is probably overfitted on kucoin. It will behave wildly different on other exchanges. (ex. Binance) <br>
The ```BB_RPB_TSL_BI``` version is for Binance. 
### 4) Don't use volume list or use volume list with very strict filters
This strategy is not optimized towards all trading pairs, and it cannot predict and prevent P&D (pump and dump).
### 5) If you want to show appreciation, 
Please notice a huge part of this strategy is a re-combination of NFI, I don't deserve the credit.
